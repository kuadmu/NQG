This is the data sample for 'Harvesting Shopping Advice: Neural Question Generation from Multiple Information Sources in E-commerce'.

Each file contains 50 lines, and each line specifies an instance for generating purchase-related questions.
Q: questions.txt
R: customer_reviews.txt
A: interest_aspects.txt
P: product_properties.txt

Note that:
1. one instance matches 4-17 customer reviews, separated by tab;
2. one instance matches at least one interest aspects, separated by space;  
3. one instance matches multiple product properties, separated by space;
4. all numbers are transformed into the tag [NUM].

The complete Q-RAP dataset will be released soon...
